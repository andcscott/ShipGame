# ShipGame

ShipGame is a Battleship-like game for two players. This code provides
a backend for the game written in Python.

Each player has a 10x10 grid on which they place their ships. On their
turn, the player fires a torpedo at a square on their opponents grid.
Player 'first' gets the first turn, after which the players alternate. A
ship is sunk when all of its squares have been hit. A player wins when
all of their opponents ships have been sunk.
